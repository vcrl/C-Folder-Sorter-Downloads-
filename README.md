# C++ Downloads Folder Sorter
Are you tired of seeing how messy your Downloads folder became ? Me too !
That's why I've made this simple yet useful tool to get rid of that problem.

# How to use it

1. Download or clone that repo on your computer
2. Move the file "file_sorter.exe" and the folder "dll" into your Downloads directory
3. Double click on "file_sorter.exe"
4. Refresh your folder using the F5 key
5. Enjoy and feel free to remove the "dll" folder

# How to know where my files are

To help you locate your files, I've added a feature that will generate a logs.log file which contains the history of every operations, sorted by date.
Just open the logs.log file and it should look like this :
```
Wed Jan 13 17:33:14 2021
 [Moved file: .\setup.exe to Executables/]
Wed Jan 13 17:33:14 2021
 [Moved file: .\file_sorter.exe to Executables/]
Wed Jan 13 17:33:14 2021
 [Moved file: .\myfile.zip to Compressed/]
```

/!\ When sorting your files, "file_sorter.exe" will sort itself into your Executables folder.

# Thank you for using this tool.
